Our project uses different Minecraft software to teach math and physics through programming. Students will be able to create their own mods and simulations in the 3D world of Minecraft, making learning fun and interactive. By applying mathematical and physical concepts, students will develop critical thinking and problem solving skills while gaining a deeper understanding of these topics. Our program offers endless possibilities for students to explore while learning valuable skills that can be applied beyond the classroom.
